# LocalHost
___
### Dev Bootcamp Final Project, November 28 - December 3, 2016
When traveling solo to a new destination, visitors can be overwhelmed by their new environment. LocalHost connects area hosts, who specialize in categories like 'Art', 'Music', or 'Food & Drink', to visitors looking for someone to show them around.

This project is live on Heroku: https://mysterious-badlands-77198.herokuapp.com/
